The purpose of this project is to build a neural network architecture from scratch (only using the python library NumPy)
It was intended for this nn to learn all of the logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) independently
*Note: you can un-comment the line that specifies a seed for numpy to get guaranteed results (successful convergence) or you can run it with random seeds every time by leaving it commented
An entire explanation can be found on my blog (writing in progress, you can follow this link to the unfinished/unedited blog: https://medium.com/@aks.replies/how-to-write-a-simple-neural-network-from-scratch-with-python-learning-logic-gates-d960513681f9)
