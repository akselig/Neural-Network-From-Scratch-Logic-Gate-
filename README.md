The purpose of this project was to build a neural network architecture from scratch (only using the python library NumPy)
This nn successfully can learn all of the logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) independently. For an overview of each part, see [here](https://medium.com/@aks.replies/how-to-write-a-simple-neural-network-from-scratch-with-python-learning-logic-gates-d960513681f9).
